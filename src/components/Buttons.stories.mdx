# Buttons

Buttons are used to trigger actions within an application.

## Usage

Buttons are used to trigger internal actions within your web applications.

## Primary Buttons

Primary buttons are used as a call to action and indicate the most important action on a page.

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story name="primary">
    <PrimaryButton>Submit</PrimaryButton>
  </Story>
</Preview>

## Secondary Buttons

Secondary buttons are used to indicate that an action is possible, but is less important than one represented by a primary button.

<Story name="secondary">
  <SecondaryButton>Submit</SecondaryButton>
</Story>

## Large and Small Buttons

Different button sizes might be appropriate for the component that you are working on.

### Large 
<Story name="large">
  <LargeButton>Submit</LargeButton>
</Story>

### Small
<Story name="small">
  <SmallButton>Submit</SmallButton>
</Story>

## Tertiary Button

Tertiary Buttons are used primarily in the navbar.

<Story name="tertiary">
  <TertiaryButton>Submit</TertiaryButton>
</Story>
